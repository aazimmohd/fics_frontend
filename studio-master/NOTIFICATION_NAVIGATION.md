# ðŸ”— Clickable Notification Navigation

## Overview

Notifications are now clickable and will navigate users to the relevant content based on the notification type. This provides a seamless user experience when users want to take action on notifications.

## How It Works

### Task Notifications
When a user clicks on a task notification:
1. The notification is automatically marked as read
2. The user is navigated to the `/tasks` page
3. The specific task modal is automatically opened
4. The `taskId` query parameter is removed from the URL

### Trigger Run Notifications
When a user clicks on a trigger run notification:
1. The notification is automatically marked as read
2. The user is navigated to the specific trigger run page (`/trigger-runs/{runId}`)

### Workflow Notifications
When a user clicks on a workflow notification:
1. The notification is automatically marked as read
2. The user is navigated to the workflows page with the specific workflow highlighted

## Implementation Details

### Frontend Changes

#### Notification Bell Component (`notification-bell.tsx`)
- Added `useRouter` for navigation
- Added `task_id`, `trigger_run_id`, and `workflow_id` to the Notification interface
- Added `handleNotificationClick` function to handle navigation
- Made notification items clickable with hover effects
- Added `stopPropagation` to the mark-as-read button to prevent navigation when clicking the checkmark

#### Tasks Page (`tasks/page.tsx`)
- Added `useSearchParams` to read query parameters
- Added `useEffect` to handle `taskId` query parameter
- Automatically opens task modal when `taskId` is present
- Removes the query parameter from URL after processing

### Backend Support
The notification system already includes the necessary fields:
- `task_id`: Links to specific tasks
- `trigger_run_id`: Links to specific trigger runs
- `workflow_id`: Links to specific workflows

## Testing

### Manual Testing
1. **Create a test task notification:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   source venv/bin/activate
   python test_notification_navigation.py
   ```

2. **Test the navigation:**
   - Go to the frontend
   - Click the bell icon in the header
   - Find the test notification: "New Task Assigned: Test Task for Notification Navigation"
   - Click on the notification
   - Verify it navigates to the tasks page and opens the task modal

### Test Page
Visit `/test-notifications` to:
- View current notification stats
- Test notification functionality
- See recent notifications
- Test the new clickable functionality

## User Experience

### Visual Indicators
- Notifications have a `cursor-pointer` style
- Hover effects show the notification is clickable
- The checkmark button for marking as read has `stopPropagation` to prevent accidental navigation

### Navigation Flow
1. User sees notification in bell icon
2. User clicks on notification
3. Notification is marked as read automatically
4. User is navigated to relevant page
5. Specific content is highlighted/opened

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
- Add visual indicators for different notification types (task, workflow, etc.)
- Add breadcrumb navigation back to notifications
- Add keyboard shortcuts for quick navigation
- Add notification history/archive page
- Add bulk actions for multiple notifications

### Additional Navigation Types
- Form submission notifications â†’ Form submissions page
- User invitation notifications â†’ User management page
- System alert notifications â†’ System status page

## Technical Notes

### URL Structure
- Task notifications: `/tasks?taskId={taskId}`
- Trigger run notifications: `/trigger-runs/{runId}`
- Workflow notifications: `/workflows?workflowId={workflowId}`

### State Management
- Notifications are marked as read immediately when clicked
- Query parameters are cleaned up after processing
- React Query cache is invalidated to ensure fresh data

### Error Handling
- If a task/workflow/trigger run doesn't exist, the navigation gracefully fails
- Users are redirected to the main page if the specific item is not found
- Console errors are logged for debugging purposes
